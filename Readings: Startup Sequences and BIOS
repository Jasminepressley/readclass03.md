#Readings: Startup Sequences and BIOS/(CLASS-READ 03 NOTES)

#Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters? 
  -Bios matters because its an important factor on how you computer operates. Which include Booting The Computer, Loading The Operating System, Hardware Configuration, 
Security, Firmware Updates, Legacy Support, System Recovery and Overclocking. That being said BIOS plays a crucial role in this module as we break down how a computer works    

##1.What is the BIOS?
  -BIOS stands for "Basic Input/Output System."
  Its a systen utility program that loads the operating system when the computer is turned on

##2.Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
  -During the booting process from past experince the my computer was identying current issue that were going on like 
operating system not working or any error codes would pop up identify what was going on. 
  
##3.What is the “Power On Self Test”?
  -This is when you turn on a computer. Bios runs multiple diagnostic test on hardware components to verify they are working
correctly. If any errors arise, Bios will display error messages with details of finding. It also my beep to indicating 
there is an underlying problem. 
  
##4.What is the CMOS?
  -CMOS stands for “Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor” This type of semiconductor technology is used in the manufacturing 
of circuits with include microprocessor, memory chips and other digital logic circuits.Key features and characteristics of CMO.  -Complementary,-Low Power -Consumption, -High noise immunty, Scalability, -Wide Application Range, -Memory Cells, -Digital Logic, Integrated    Circuits  
  
##5.What is the CMOS battery?
  -Its a small coin cell battery located on the motherboard and other devices to provide power to CMOS chip.
